# Methodology

This security code review followed a comprehensive 6-phase approach based on source-to-sink data flow analysis:

## Review Phases

1. **Business Context Discovery**
   - Analyzed application purpose, features, and architecture
   - Identified technology stack and dependencies
   - Mapped business workflows and user types

2. **Asset Identification**
   - Catalogued sensitive data (PII, financial, credentials)
   - Identified high-value targets from attacker perspective
   - Mapped external integrations and system privileges

3. **Attack Surface Enumeration**
   - Documented all entry points (HTTP endpoints, WebSocket, file uploads, etc.)
   - Mapped authentication and authorization boundaries
   - Identified input vectors and trust boundaries

4. **Data Flow Analysis (Source-to-Sink)**
   - Traced untrusted data from sources to sensitive operations (sinks)
   - Identified validation and sanitization checkpoints
   - Prioritized flows intersecting high-value assets

5. **Vulnerability Analysis**
   - Deep analysis of high-risk data flows
   - Verified exploitability with proof-of-concept attacks
   - Mapped findings to OWASP Top 10 and CWE
   - Calculated CVSS v3.1 and risk matrix scores

6. **Report Generation**
   - Synthesized findings into executive summary
   - Developed remediation roadmap with prioritization
   - Assessed compliance impact

## Risk Scoring Methodology

### CVSS v3.1 (Technical Severity)
Each finding was scored using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1 based on:
- Attack vector, complexity, and prerequisites
- Impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- Scope of potential damage

Severity ranges:
- **Critical**: 9.0-10.0
- **High**: 7.0-8.9
- **Medium**: 4.0-6.9
- **Low**: 0.1-3.9

### Impact × Likelihood Matrix (Business Risk)
Each finding was also scored using a business risk matrix:
- **Impact** (1-5): Business consequence if exploited
- **Likelihood** (1-5): Probability of exploitation
- **Risk Score**: Impact × Likelihood (1-25)

This dual scoring provides both technical and business perspectives on each vulnerability.
